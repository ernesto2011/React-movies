# Movie App using React and TMDB api
this app is based on a free movie API, the main use of this app is to show up the different movies and their ranking, i tried in this app to use different packages to make the design looks very nice (sliders, hover effects)

## How to use the app
```sh
cd React-movies
npm install
npm start
```
